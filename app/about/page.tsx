        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Tom. I'm an English teacher from the USA.</p>
        <p>
          I started teaching in 2020, both in schools and online, and my goal is
          to be as amazing of a teacher as my English teachers were when I was
          in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of teaching, my hobbies include running, drawing, computer
          programming, travelling, taking photos, and learning random new
          things. I'm currently training to run a marathon!
        </p>

        <h3>My pedagogical approach</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone learns differently, and that is something I keep in mind when
          planning my classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've developed a flexible approach that combines
          different teaching methodologies depending on the needs of the group or 
          individual. I can work with traditional language instruction when necessary, but I also 
          put a lot of importance on utilizing the language and understanding it in a natural way
          through active learning practices.
        </p>
