    question: "How can I join the online classes?",
    answer:
      "All classes are held via Google Meet, a simple platform that can be accessed from any device. Once you reserve your spot, you'll receive the access link by email. There's no need to install anything if you use a computer — you only need a good internet connection. If you use a phone or tablet, you can download the free Google Meet app.",

    question: "What are the levels?",
    answer:
      "The levels I use to organize the classes follow the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), an international guide that classifies language proficiency from A1 (beginner) to C2 (advanced). This scale makes it clear what someone can do in English at each stage — for example: introduce themselves, hold a conversation, write a formal email, understand complex texts, and so on. Before starting, we assess your level so you can learn with materials and activities that match your knowledge and goals.",

    question: "What is the process for the language level assessment?",
    answer:
      "All students, except those who indicate they have never studied English before and have no skills in the language, must go through the placement process before their first class. It begins with an online placement test to assess the student's knowledge of the language's grammar, followed by a scheduled listening and oral comprehension test in English. This allows me to accurately determine each student's specific skills and needs.",
